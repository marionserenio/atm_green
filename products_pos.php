			<h4>Customer Service</h4>
			<p>In our on the go world, convenience is king. POS’s has become one of the most used services at convenience stores. For the past three years, adults between the ages of 18 and 39 years have used POS's more often than any other convenience service except air hoses, pay phones and restrooms. During the last few years, POS usage has grown to twice that of Cheque Cashing services and three times that of Money Orders.</p>

			<h4>Increased Register Receipts</h4>
			<p>Your location will realize increased customer spending. Most of the money made with a POS is reflected in your daily register receipts with an average sales increase of 15%. POS users buy on average more per transaction resulting in 20% more cash being spent on site than if they had only cash.</p>

			<h4>Increased Foot Traffic</h4>
			<p>Increased foot traffic is the #1 reason convenience stores have POS's. The reason is simple. Potential customers will pass by to get cash somewhere else and might not have time to get back to spend it in their stores. Customers today will choose a merchant with a POS for the security and convenience of completing a transaction inside of a location. Consumers will modify buying patterns to shop at a store that has a POS. 51% of shoppers that are between the ages 25-49 uses POS more than 8 times a week.</p>

			<h4>Surcharge Revenue</h4>
			<p>The POS owner could receive surcharge revenues. Your overall strategy should be to get as many potential customers to use your machine as possible. It's better to have 400 people a month use you’re POS at $1.50 per transaction, than to have 300 people use it for $2.00. While both scenarios generate $600 a month in surcharge revenue, the $1.50 machine gives you an extra 100 customers a month, while putting thousands of dollars into their spending hands.</p>

			<h4>Tax Benefits</h4>
			<p>Your monthly lease payment can be deducted as an operating expense.</p>

			<h4>Future</h4>
			<p>Think of the future possibility as the proliferation of POS's takes on new exciting income opportunities.</p>
