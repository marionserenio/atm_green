				<h4>Check Processing Services</h4>
				<p>InstaCasthATM Inc., a leading provider in the check services industry, offers solutions that provide thoroughness, speed, and reliability, making it easy for merchants to accept checks with confidence.</p>
				<h4>Traditional Guarantee</h4>
				<p>Check Guarantee is the most commonly used check service allowing the merchant to “insure” the face value of the check and protecting the merchant against checks written on non-sufficient funds (NSF). Merchants obtain electronic approval or voice authorization for the transaction and then deposit the checks. Checks that do not clear can be submitted to MerchantPoint for reimbursement. This reimbursement typically takes 2-4 weeks from the time of receipt of the original item, and is processed electronically via the ACH. It is sent under a specific category, so the merchant can identify that the credit is for a bounced item.
				</p>
				<h4>Check Verification</h4>		
				<p>Verification allows merchants to access the MerchantPoint Negative Database to verify negative information regarding a particular check or check-writer. The merchant is simply “purchasing” information to aid in the decision to accept or decline a check. MerchantPoint provides an approval based on whether or not there is a positive match on the checking account number or home telephone number of the check-writer in the negative database. The decision to accept any check remains solely up to the merchant.</p>
