		<h5>Benefits</h5>
						<p>People depend on ATMs for cash. An ATM at your location attracts customers by allowing them to combine banking and shopping in one trip. <br>
						Builds Sales. The typical ATM customer spends 20-25% more than a non-ATM customer <br>
						Provides a Competitive Edge. <br>
						Increased Foot Traffic. <br>
						Extra and Superior Sales. <br>
						Increase Cash Revenues	<br>
						Reduced Operating Costs. <br>
						Added Profits. <br>
					<h6>Customer Service</h6>
						<p>In our on the go world, convenience is king. ATM’s have become one of the most used services at convenience stores. For the past three years adults between the ages of 18 and 39 years have used ATMs more often than any other convenience service except air hoses, pay phones and restrooms. During the last few years ATM usage has grown to twice that of Cheque Cashing services and three times that of Money Orders.
						</p>
					<h6>Increased Register Receipts</h6>
					<p>Your location will realize increased customer spending. Most of the money made with an ATM is reflected in your daily register receipts with an average sales increase of 15%. ATM users withdraw an average of $60 per transaction resulting in 30-60 % of cash withdrawn being spent on site, 20% more than if they didn’t have cash.</p>
					<h6>Increased Foot Traffic</h6>	
					<p>Increased foot traffic is the #1 reason convenience stores has ATMs. The reason is simple. Potential customers will pass by to get cash somewhere else and might not have time to get back to spend it in their stores. Customers today will choose a merchant with an ATM for the security and convenience of completing a transaction inside of a location. Consumers will modify buying patterns to combine shopping and banking. 51% between the ages 25-49 use ATMs 8 times a month with an average withdrawal of 62.00.</p>	
					<h6>Decreased Credit Card and Cheque Expenses</h6>	
					<p>There are a significant segment of credit card users who would prefer to pay in cash, given the opportunity. These customer switchovers will save you an average of $0.80 per transaction. Plus you are earning surcharge revenue. Cash eliminates the risk of cheque acceptance or the cost of cheque guard services. Replacing cheque or credit card transactions with cash will reduce checkout time, resulting in satisfied customers and lower labor cost.</p>
 					<h6>Surcharge Revenue</h6>
 					<p>2-5 percent of foot traffic will use your ATM. The ATM owner and vault cash provider receive the surcharge revenues. Your overall strategy should be to get as many potential customers to use your machine as possible. It's better to have 400 people a month use your ATM at $1.50 per transaction, than to have 300 people use it for $2.00. While both scenarios generate $600 a month in surcharge revenue, the $1.50 machine gives you an extra 100 customers a month, while putting thousands of dollars into their spending hands.
 					</p>
 					<h6>Tax Benefits</h6>
 					<p>Your monthly lease payment can be deducted as an operating expense.</p>
 					<h6>Future</h6>
 					<p>Think of the future possibility as the proliferation of ATMs takes on new exciting income opportunities.</p>
